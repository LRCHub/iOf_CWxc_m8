I for one will say
I haven't seen if all I know
The second chance for me
Was long ago so strange and still

(Honestly) had to think about
The world I took that brought me here
(WHO AM I) supposed to be?
I breath, I bleed

I'm here to show you all
My mistakes
(IT'S RIGHT HERE BESIDE YOU)

Lie next to me
And you'll see I'm the scapegoat
I'm here to tell you that this ride's not for free

Look at me I'm a scapegoat
What will you do about it?
Find a memory

To look at life and understand that

(I CAN'T STOP) what's supposed to be
But I can show you what it will take
(IF YOU WOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN)
Lie next to me
And you'll see I'm the scapegoat
I'm here to tell you that this ride's not for free
Look at me I'm the scapegoat
What will you do about it?
(LIE)
SCAPEGOAT
Lie next to me
And you'll see I'm the scapegoat
I'm here to tell you that this ride's not for free
Look at me I'm the scapegoat
What will you do about it?
About it
What will you do about it?
Look at me I'm a scapegoat
What will you do about it?
