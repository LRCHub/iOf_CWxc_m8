When the bar door opens
The conversation closes
Chit-chat commences, the necks bent back
You spend more time looking for some action
How can you talk when you could care less?

What'cha drinking?
What's your major?
Man, I don't even care

All this small talk's drinking up my time
Man, I just want to blow into thin air

I want to stretch the night out
Like a rubber
Band that snaps me to that cutie's clutch
I zero in on the onstage onslaught
Most times even that doesn't thrill me much

What's he smoking?
Who's she seeing?
Man, I don't even care

All this small talk's drinking up my time
Man, I just want to blow into thin air
I only want to blow into thin air

The catty gossip and the all shit talking
This scapegoat soup is bubbling hot
Fingers pointing, bad blood boiling
Can't take the heat, turn the volume up!

What'cha drinking?
Who's she seeing?
Man, I don't even care

All this small talk's drinking up my time
Man, I just want to blow into thin air
I only want to blow into thin air
I only want to blow into thin air
